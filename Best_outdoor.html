        <p class="mt-3">Guys have recently try out most affordable flashlights for my photoshoots in outdoor and in indoor situation If you have a Sony camera, you should watch this video since it is the first time I've tested a budget light that produces output of exceptionally high quality during a photo shoot.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            Yes, I'm referring to off-camera strob lights and strobes.In the Indian market, there are only a few possibilities, such as go dogs and Digitek and Simpex type bands, but the problem is that the godox is twice as expensive and the Simpex and digitek products are of very poor quality.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            I was seeking for a reasonably priced light that could provide beautiful results and also had nice construction, so I looked online and discovered that Visico 5 and Visico 2 are both camera flash lights that can be used for photo shoots both inside and outside.
            Let's begin by speaking with a Visico 5.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            Visico 5 has a 400 watt output, making it an extremely bright light that can be used both indoors and outdoors. Obviously, this light can sync at 1/8000 of a shutter speed because it has HSS mode, which makes life simpler when shooting outside and compensating for sunlight.
        </p> 
        <p class="mt-2">
            Hence, the torch This lamp has a bone mount connection, so you can attach any of these boxes that work with these lights to it. Overall, the Visico 5's construction is very, very good, and its battery life is truly amazing—it can last for more than 2000 photos on a single charge and has a 13-watt LED bulb as part of its design.
        </p>    
        <p class="mt-2">
            The recycling This light's rate is likewise excellent. This torch can be recharged in less than 0.5 seconds, which I think makes it ideal for shooting interior weddings and outdoor photos.Now let's talk about Visico 2, which is sort of a brother of Visico 5.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
             It is a less powerful and most compact flashlight, and it comes with a round Mount with a magnetic loop, allowing you to attach magnetic filters, CTO filters, and other accessories to the light's top. It is the most compact light on the market, weighing only 700 grammes, and it also has a very high output of 200 wat, allowing you to use it as either a key light or a back
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            Please watch my entire review video in the description to learn more about how the products performed overall in terms of images and films. Both lights are quite reasonable and excellent buys for photo creation. <a href="https://youtu.be/zAhZkCYW31Q">check out my full YouTube Review on camera flash lights</a>.
