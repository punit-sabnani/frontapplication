        <p class="mt-3">Hello guys and hope you all are doing well. I am your host  Puneet and you all have been requesting for a long time that FX30 which is Sony's new cinema line camera along with it the 18-105mm which is actually the best combination in the world.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            If you want to do camcorder style videography or coverage videography then I am going to tell you how it is going to perform with this lens. This camera is one of the best combination with this lens. If you are looking for a budget lens which can sort your maximum purpose.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            If you do documentary filmmaking or wedding filmmaking but you want to make kind of traditional video or coverage video and you want to make cinematic video. So I think it is a very good lens to have in your bag or to make a video on it. So I am using this lens for the last 2-3 months and I really love this lens with this particular
            combination with FX30. The price of this lens is Rs. 47,000 and in the market you will get it somewhere around Rs. 40,000 and the body itself of FX30 is very affordable. You can get FX30 in the market for around Rs. 1,70,000.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            If you are looking for an affordable setup then I think this is the best lens combination if you want to go for documentary style of filmmaking or coverage style of filmmaking. This lens has a focal length of 18mm and it will go up to 105mm plus it comes with F4
            fixed aperture. Along with that this lens is a power zoom lens. We call it PZ lens basically. The advantage of power zoom is that as soon as you press the staller which you get to see on FX30, you get to see the zoom in and zoom out feature.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            That is why this is a very good option to have in your bag for documentary style of First of all, this F4 is constant so whenever you zoom in or zoom out, like if you have used camcorders, you might notice that the aperture of the camcorders changes but here there is no change in the aperture because this F4 is fixed.
        </p>    
        <p class="mt-2">
            Along with that if you use this on a gimbal for cinematic video shooting, then another advantage is that the zoom in and zoom out feature is present in the barrel. You won't be able to see any movement outside the barrel. The barrel doesn't extend. 
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            So suppose if you have used this on a gimbal or crane or rig and you have balanced it
            and if you are controlling the zoom in and zoom out then it won't create any type of disbalance during the video production. Now in terms of autofocus, the autofocus performance of this lens is also very good. It focuses on the subject corner to corner and this lens has an amazing compatibility
            with this particular camera.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            This lens works very well with this camera. You will get 18 wide and 105 close up. So if you want to take a wide shot, you can take it at 18mm and you get a lot of mid focal length. This is why this lens is very popular with this camera because it covers most of the
            important focal length from 18mm to 105mm. 
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            In terms of videos, the performance of this camera is very good. It records sharp images of very good quality. I have literally shot 4K videos with this camera and I have tested how sharp it is in 4K. You get a very good overall response. If you are at a distance of 10 feet and you want to take a close up of the subject from
            10 feet then this lens gives you that range.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
            In 18mm and 105mm, this lens gives you a zoom of 7-8x if you are doing optical zooming. You also get a digital zoom option in this camera so you can extend the focal length where the quality is compromised.
            But in emergency cases, you get a little more zoom. So in totality, you will get a zoom of 12-13x if you use the digital zoom feature. Overall, the best thing about the FX30 is that you get a top handle which gives you more stability during the video shoot
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
